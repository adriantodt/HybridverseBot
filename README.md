        <h2>Building Mantaro on your own</h2>
        <p><b>WARNING</b>: <a href="https://github.com/adriantodt"><b>@AdrianTodt</b></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kodehawa"><b>@Kodehawa</b></a> do not</b> recommend compiling Mantaro as it is not documented and most builds here will be extremely unstable and untested.<br>If you still want to build your own instance of Mantaro, you will need multiple api keys including <b>(but not limited to)</b></p>

            <li>AniList API</li>

        </ul>
        <p><b>We will not help you with the process of obtaining said api keys.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Steps for building</b></p>

        <h2>Konachan notice (net.kodehawa.lib.imageboard.konachan)</h2>
        <p>That package is a port of the <a href="https://github.com/Mxrck/KonachanLib"><b>original konachan library</b></a> to Java 8 and to better suit our needs. I just didn't want to post it on GitHub as a separate lib, but if anyone wants I'll do so.</p>
